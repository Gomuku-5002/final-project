# final-project
After tests, we found this algorithm is good at melee battle in the center of the chess board, but performs badly at remote battle and around the edge of the board.  
From the perspective of those weaknesses, further work can be focused on (1) expanding the MCTS region and (2) improving the chessboard edge algorithm.
